Problem 1(a):
In this assignment, you will write a client-server system using TCP sockets. Specifically, you will
write two programs, a TCP client program and an iterative TCP server program. The client
program will send a text file to the server program. The server will count the number of
sentences, words, and characters in the file and send them back to the client. The client will
then display it. The sequence of operations to be followed are shown below.
1. The server opens a TCP socket and waits for a request from the client.
2. The client reads the name of a text file from the user as a command line argument. It
then looks for the file in the local directory. If the file is not there, it prints a suitable error
message (“File not found”) and exits. If the file is found, thew steps below are executed.
You can assume that the file name has maximum 100 characters and the file, if found,
will always be a text file containing English sentences.
